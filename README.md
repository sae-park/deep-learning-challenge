# deep-learning-challenge

This project uses a deep learning neural network to predict whether applicants will be successful in securing charitable donations. The model was trained on historical application data from Alphabet Soup, a fictional nonprofit organization.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Converted categorical data, removed irrelevant columns, and split data into training/testing sets.

Model Architecture: Built a neural network with 3 hidden layers (80, 30, and 10 neurons) using ReLU activations; output layer used sigmoid for binary classification.

Performance Optimization: Tweaked neuron counts, activation functions, and added dropout layers to improve accuracy.

Evaluation: Compared performance against a baseline model and iteratively improved the deep learning network.
